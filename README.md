# Face-Aging-with-IPC-GAN
This project utilizes an IPC-GAN (Intrinsic Person Characteristics-preserving Generative Adversarial Network) to simulate the  aging process in human faces. This involves training a machine learning model to generate realistic facial images that depict how  a person's appearance may change with age while preserving their unique characteristics.
